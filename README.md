# Testing-of-sorting-Algorithms

## Overview

This repository contains a detailed analysis and comparison of various sorting algorithms through both theoretical analysis and practical performance experiments. The research was conducted by Valentin Cosmin Cîrju from the Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, West University of Timișoara, Romania.

## Research Objectives

The primary goal of this research is to compare the efficiency of different sorting algorithms by analyzing both their theoretical properties and their practical performance. Sorting is a fundamental task in computer science, and efficiency becomes a major concern when dealing with large datasets. The study aims to provide a comprehensive comparison from the perspective of complexity order, execution time, and the number of swaps for various sorting algorithms, emphasizing their practical performance and concluding with theoretical findings.

## Introduction

### Research Objective

The main objective of this research is to conduct an exhaustive analysis of sorting algorithms through literature review and potential implementations. The algorithms will be defined and explained in detail, and their efficiency and other properties will be rigorously analyzed and compared. The study will also collect data regarding the execution time of different sorting algorithms to compare the practicality of their implementation variants.

### Practical Examples

Here are a few examples illustrating the advantages of sorting and searching in an ordered list compared to an unordered list:

- **Duplicate Removal**: Sorting elements before removing duplicates significantly reduces the time required for this process compared to processing an unordered list.
- **Data Search**: Searching for data in an ordered list allows for faster location of the desired element compared to an exhaustive search in an unordered list.
- **Social Media Platforms**: Relevant posts are displayed on the main page for users by sorting all available posts based on their relevance and displaying them in descending order of relevance.

## Formal Problem Statement and Solution

Since ancient times, organizing goods by sorting or grouping them into categories has been a simple form of systematic organization. Sorting refers to the process of ordering a list of elements according to a specific criterion, and the efficiency of sorting concerning memory usage and execution time is crucial for data interpretation.

## Modeling and Implementation

This study examines seven sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Radix Sort, Heap Sort, and Quick Sort. These algorithms are widely used in sorting lists of elements and present significant differences in terms of efficiency and performance in various usage scenarios.

## Experiment

### Execution Time

Experiments were conducted to measure the execution time of each sorting algorithm under different conditions.

### Number of Swaps

The number of swaps required by each sorting algorithm was also recorded and analyzed.

## Comparison with Literature

The findings of this research are compared with existing literature to validate the results and provide a broader context.

## Conclusions and Future Directions

The research concludes with theoretical findings and suggests future directions for the development and optimization of applications involving the sorting of large datasets.
